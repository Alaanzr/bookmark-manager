# Relational DB vs NoSQL vs Flat files:
#### **Relational DB**: The relational database organizes data into table with columns and row.Each row has an unique 'primary key' identifying the row. The column represent a row attribute. Most of the relational database system use SQL (Structured Query Language) as the language for insert, querying, updating and deleting information.

#### **NoSQL** is a non relational database so without a predefined schema. The simplest NoSql structure is the Hash (key => value) that let the NoSQL being more scalable, agile and provides superior performance.

#### The **Flat Files** has not relational structure. An example of Flat Files is a text document or lines of ASCII test. Usually the flat files contain one record per line separated with a comma.
